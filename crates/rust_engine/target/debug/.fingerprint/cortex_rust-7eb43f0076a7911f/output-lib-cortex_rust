{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"type annotations needed","code":{"code":"E0282","explanation":"The compiler could not infer a type and asked for a type annotation.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0282\nlet x = Vec::new();\n```\n\nThis error indicates that type inference did not result in one unique possible\ntype, and extra information is required. In most cases this can be provided\nby adding a type annotation. Sometimes you need to specify a generic type\nparameter manually.\n\nIn the example above, type `Vec` has a type parameter `T`. When calling\n`Vec::new`, barring any other later usage of the variable `x` that allows the\ncompiler to infer what type `T` is, the compiler needs to be told what it is.\n\nThe type can be specified on the variable:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();\n```\n\nThe type can also be specified in the path of the expression:\n\n```\nlet x = Vec::<i32>::new();\n```\n\nIn cases with more complex types, it is not necessary to annotate the full\ntype. Once the ambiguity is resolved, the compiler can infer the rest:\n\n```\nlet x: Vec<_> = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect();\n```\n\nAnother way to provide the compiler with enough information, is to specify the\ngeneric type parameter:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<char>>();\n```\n\nAgain, you need not specify the full type if the compiler can infer it:\n\n```\nlet x = \"hello\".chars().rev().collect::<Vec<_>>();\n```\n\nApart from a method or function with a generic type parameter, this error can\noccur when a type parameter of a struct or trait cannot be inferred. In that\ncase it is not always possible to use a type annotation, because all candidates\nhave the same return type. For instance:\n\n```compile_fail,E0282\nstruct Foo<T> {\n    num: T,\n}\n\nimpl<T> Foo<T> {\n    fn bar() -> i32 {\n        0\n    }\n\n    fn baz() {\n        let number = Foo::bar();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis will fail because the compiler does not know which instance of `Foo` to\ncall `bar` on. Change `Foo::bar()` to `Foo::<T>::bar()` to resolve the error.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src\\bit_linear.rs","byte_start":1586,"byte_end":1597,"line_start":42,"line_end":42,"column_start":46,"column_end":57,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        let x_quant: Array1<i8> = x.mapv(|v| (v * scale).round().clamp(-127.0, 127.0) as i8);","highlight_start":46,"highlight_end":57}],"label":"cannot infer type","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0282]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m\u001b[97m: type annotations needed\u001b[0m\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[96m--> \u001b[0msrc\\bit_linear.rs:42:46\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96m42\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m         let x_quant: Array1<i8> = x.mapv(|v| (v * scale).round().clamp(-127.0, 127.0) as i8);\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[96m|\u001b[0m                                              \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[91mcannot infer type\u001b[0m\n\n"}
