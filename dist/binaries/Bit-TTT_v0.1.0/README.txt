# Bit-TTT Engine v0.1.0

This is a standalone distribution.

## How to Run
Double-click `start_demo.bat` to run the sample model.

## Requirements
- Windows 10/11 x64
- (Optional) CUDA 11.8+ for GPU support.

## Note
The included model is a 10M parameter dummy model with random weights.
It will output random tokens, but proves the engine is working.
To use a real model, download a `.bitt` or `.safetensors` model and update the batch file.
