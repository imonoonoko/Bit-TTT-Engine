# Verification Plan: Phase C

## 1. Logging Verification
- [ ] **CLI Output**: Run `bit_llama train ...` and verify logs appear in stdout with timestamps/levels.
- [ ] **GUI Output**: Run `bit_llama gui` and verify logs appear in the "Logs" tab.
- [ ] **Filtering**: Verify `RUST_LOG` env var controls output verbosity.

## 2. Loader Verification
- [ ] **Refactoring Safety**: Run `pre_demon.py` smoke test after extracting `DataLoader`. It must pass.
- [ ] **Evaluation**: Run `bit_llama eval` and compare results with pre-refactor version (if possible) or just ensure it runs without error.

## 3. Config Verification
- [ ] **Save/Load**: Verify `config.json` generated by `train` can be loaded by `inference` or `export`.
